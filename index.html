 <h2 class="MUSIC"><strong>MUSIC</strong> </h2>
 <p class="first-p">
 <em>Music</em> , art concerned with combining vocal or instrumental sounds for beauty of form or emotional expression, usually according to cultural standards of rhythm, melody, and, in most Western music, harmony. <br> Both the simple folk song and the complex electronic composition belong to the same activity, music. Both are humanly engineered; both are conceptual and auditory, and these factors have been present in music of all styles and in all periods of history, throughout the world.
 <br> Throughout history, music has been an important adjunct to ritual and drama and has been credited with the capacity to reflect and influence human emotion. <br>Popular culture has consistently exploited these possibilities, most conspicuously today by means of radio, film, television, musical theatre, and the Internet. The implications of the uses of music in psychotherapy, geriatrics, and advertising testify to a faith in its power to affect human behaviour.
<br> Musical instruments are treated in electronic instrument, keyboard instrument, percussion instrument, stringed instrument, and wind instrument, as well as in separate articles on individual instruments, such as clarinet, drum, guitar, kayag≈≠m, piano, tabla, and theremin. <br>
Nowdays everytime everywhere wherever the eye's go you'll find music travelling with you , no matter if you only just play any instrument or bang a table or hit a tuning fork everything contain music in it.  </p>

  <h2 class="drum-h-2"> The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. Drums are usually played by striking with the hand, or with one or two sticks with or without padding. A wide variety of sticks are used, including wooden sticks and sticks with soft beaters of felt on the end. In jazz, some drummers use brushes for a smoother, quieter sound. In many traditional cultures, drums have a symbolic function and are used in religious ceremonies. Drums are often used in music therapy, especially hand drums, because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people. </h2>
